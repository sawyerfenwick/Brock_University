<h1 style="color:#0096D6">Important delivery information</h1>
<p>For your protection, a signature is required for most deliveries. We do not allow address changes after an order has been accepted. 
	You may not export any products purchased from the HP Canada Store.</p>
<p>Most orders will be received within 3-5 business days.</p>
<p>Please note that we are unable to split orders so if any items are unavailable we will hold your order until we 
	can deliver all of the items in your order. If you require an item that is in stock quickly please place a separate order for this item.</p>
<h1 style="color:#0096D6">Delivery date information</h1>
<p>At Printer Sellers Ltd. we know that fast, reliable shipment of your merchandise is important to you. We ship many orders the same business day. 
	Orders placed weekdays after 5 p.m. Eastern time (2 p.m. Pacific time), weekends, holidays and orders containing certain large products ship the 
	next business day. Our deliveries take place Monday to Friday (excluding bank holidays).</p>
<h1 style="color:#0096D6">How to track your order</h1>
<p>You will receive an order confirmation e-mail from the HP Canada Store immediately after your order has been placed.</p>
<p>You will receive a second email after your order has been shipped with a shipment tracking number.</p>
<h1 style="color:#0096D6">How to change or cancel an order</h1>
<p>If you need to make a change or notice a mistake on an order you’ve already placed, please contact our Customer Service team using the contact details below as soon possible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we are unable to add additional items to an existing order once processed so if you’d like to purchase extra items either place a new order via our website or contact our Sales team directly.</p>
